A plugin to connect your Wview-enabled weather station to your Wordpress site with Widgets!


== Description ==

This plugin connects to files generated by the WView weather server software (or other software using the supported format and naming conventions) and displays the weather data in wordpress using widgets.

Requirements:

1: Latest WView weather server software (http://www.wviewweather.com)

2: Bravery, Patience and Forgiveness.  This software is pre-1.0.  It is being actively and heavily worked on.  

== Installation ==

1: Install the plugin in Wordpress.

2: Install the included phpparameter.htx (found in the wxgrabber plugin directory) in WView and set to generate and upload to your root web folder

2b: If you are not running wview you can still use this plugin by having your weather software create a delimited text file similar to phpparameter.htx.  Name and value pairs can be omitted but names (before the semi-colon) MUST remain the same.

3: Setup the Weather Grabber plugin in the "Settings" area of Wordpress

4: Add and setup a Widget under Appearance

5: You're done!
